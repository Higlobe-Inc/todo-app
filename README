# To-Do List App

This project is a simple To-Do List application designed to help evaluate your skills in writing Playwright tests for automation. Follow the instructions below to install, run, and test the application on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, ensure the following are installed:

### For Windows
1. [Node.js (LTS version)](https://nodejs.org/)  
   - During installation, check the option to install npm.
   - Restart your computer after installation to ensure everything is set up correctly.

2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, if you clone via Git instead of downloading the zip file)

### For Mac
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (package manager for macOS)
   - Open the terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. Install Node.js and Git via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install node git
   ```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

#### Option 1: Clone via Git
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd to-do-app
```

#### Option 2: Download ZIP File
- Click on the "Code" button in the repository and select "Download ZIP."
- Extract the zip file and navigate to the extracted folder in your terminal or command prompt.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the project directory to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Application
Run the following command to start the To-Do List app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start, and you should see a message similar to this:
```
VITE vX.X.X  ready in X ms
  ðŸš€ Local: http://localhost:5173/
```
Open the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`) in your browser to view the application.

## Testing the Application

This project uses Playwright for automation testing. Follow these steps to run the tests:

### Step 1: Install Playwright Browsers
After installing dependencies, ensure Playwright's required browsers are installed:
```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Step 2: Run the Tests
To run all tests, execute:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Step 3: Debug Tests (Optional)
To debug the tests, run:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```
This opens the Playwright inspector, allowing you to step through the tests interactively.

## File Structure
- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
- `src/main.js`: The JavaScript logic for the To-Do app.
- `tests/todo.spec.js`: Playwright test cases.

## Additional Information

### Troubleshooting
- If `npm` is not recognized as a command, ensure Node.js is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.
- If you encounter port conflicts, stop any application running on port 5173 or specify a new port in the `vite.config.js` file.

### Useful Commands
- Start the app: `npm run dev`
- Run all tests: `npx playwright test`
- Debug tests: `npx playwright test --debug`
- Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
